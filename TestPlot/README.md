# Homework 3 Flow Visualization with Three.js Repurposed for Testing VDS LSST Project

## How to run this code?

1. clone repo (https://github.com/Nishimotord/CS529_LSST_SNe_Visualization) and make sure you are in the TestPlot/ Folder (currently in Test_Plot branch)
2. Start an http server (with python3): python -m http.server 8888
3. Go to http://localhost:8888. You should see an x,y,z axis with all of the old SNe being plotted as white pixel points
